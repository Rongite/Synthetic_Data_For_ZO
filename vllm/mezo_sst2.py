    You are tasked with rephrasing the provided sentence without changing its original sentiment and meaning. The rephrased data will be used to fine-tune a \
      model using a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer called MeZO, which reduces memory usage significantly compared to traditional backpropagation methods. \
        The goal is to generate data that helps the model achieve similar or better accuracy when fine-tuned with limited memory, compared to using the original \
          dataset.

    Below is the abstract from the MeZO research paper for context:

    "Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has yielded success on diverse downstream tasks, but as LMs grow in size, backpropagation requires a prohibitively large \
      amount of memory. Zeroth-order (ZO) methods can estimate gradients using only two forward passes but are traditionally slow for large models. In this \
        work, we propose a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (MeZO), adapting the ZO-SGD method to operate in-place with the same memory footprint as \
          inference. Our results show MeZO achieves comparable performance to backpropagation-based fine-tuning with up to 12Ã— memory reduction. This optimizer \
            allows training a 30B model on a single A100 GPU while backpropagation can only handle a 2.7B model."

    Please rephrase the sentence below while keeping its sentiment and meaning intact. Aim for diverse language usage to enhance the data quality for \
      fine-tuning with MeZO:

    Original: "{sentence}"
    Directly output a rephrased sentence without any other characters and other explanatory statements like "The rephrased sentence is:":
